\chapter{Machine Learning Tools}

This chapter introduces the tools used for the implementation of the neural network. The main tool is the Keras python library. Keras is toolset for deep learning networks developed by google that is able to run on a variety of backends. It summarizes the vector calculations needed for a neural network in modules making it perfect for fast and easy usage.\\
The backend used in this work is tensorflow.

\section{Keras}

Keras is an application programming interface. It is written in python and able to run on Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. It was developed by google and summarizes the necessary calculations for running a deep neural network training in fast and easy modules.
