\chapter{Pre-training losses}
\label{sec:app2}

This chapter shows two exemplary loss curves during the pre-training. They have not been shown in the main part. However, one can observe the dependency of the adversary on the classifier. Secondly it can be seen that the adversary does not affect the classifier.
