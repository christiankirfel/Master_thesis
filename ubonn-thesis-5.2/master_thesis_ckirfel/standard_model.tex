\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}

Originally in an attempt do unify the electromagnetic, weak and strong force under one theory the standard model of particle physics summarizes the status quo of elementary particles and their interactions. Although the model has several weaknesses it stands very strong to tests so far and 

Das STandardmodell ist nicht ohne Schwächen, hält aber experimentellen Tests in vielen Bereiche mit beeindruckneder Genauigkit stand. It is in no way a perfect and complete theoretical model but nontheless a very powerful basis for experimental predicitons.
