\chapter{Conclusions}

The work that has been presented in this thesis is split into two. First of all the behaviour of neural networks and adversarial neural networks for classification tasks in particle physics has been investigated. Influence of the hyper-parameters on network performance for different setups has been tested in order to understand how a classifier should be set up and how it can be upgraded to an adversarial neural network.

Secondly the possibilities offered by adversarial neural networks to limit the influence of systematic uncertainties on a classification model has been discussed. In particular, the technique of an adversarial network has been tested on the \tW-\ttbar separation and the systematic uncertainty arising from the different simulation approaches of DR and DS for the interference term at NLO.

A fundamental knowledge of neural networks and a set of hyper-parameters has been gathered. It has been shown that a good set of parameters is not only dependent on the topology of the problem but also heavily depends on the setup of the network structure. A good classifier does not generally also make a good basis for an adversarial network structure. Instead an adversarial network requires a low learning rate and overall a slow optimisation because more features of the problem need to be taken into account. This is due to the sensitivity to a certain systematic being added to the primary task of classification. The initial optimum that allowed for straightforward and fast training is not the desired model anymore.

Moreover, the adversarial neural network tested in this work is relatively unstable and the outcome changes heavily when hyper-parameters are slightly adjusted. This effect was not observed for the classifying network and resulted in a laborious optimisation process. This made the constraint of computational power even more significant.
The most important feature of the adversarial network, researched with the three approaches presented in chapter~\ref{chp:ANN}, is the dimension of input it is provided with. There is a strong argument that only one node, as classically suggested, does not justify a complex adversarial network architecture. In addition to that the general information lost when looking only at the final node should not be neglected during the setup. The performances achieved were strongly dependent on the shape of input.

Lastly a significant improvement on the sensitivity of the classifier for the systematic sample could not be achieved. Although the classifier was able to generate a model that rendered its adversary unable to learn no significant differences were visible in the distribution. The shapes changed but at the stage of this work no sophisticated argument can be made for an improvement. In conclusion, switching from the single-node-input to a more complex input for the adversary seems to be the more promising approach. Combined with a different set of variables and a detailed hyper-parameter scan one might be able to observe a reduction of sensitivity while keeping the quality of the overall classification.

Neural networks in general are a promising technique for researchers in particle physics. The variety of highly different structures and hyper-parameters of the networks makes them a potentially powerful tool for different scopes of duty. An improvement on a sensitivity to systematics has been achieved for different researches using adversarial network approaches. Unfortunately in this work no significant improvements were achieved. Although this might be due to the topology of the problem and the desired model not existing, with a more in-depth optimisation or a generally different setup there may well be improvements not found in this work.
