\chapter{Hyperparameter optimisation of a classifying neural network}
\label{sec:simpleNN}

The basis od the adversarial neural network is a common neural network trained on signal/background classification.
Before the adversary, second network is added the network is optimised on its own to make sure that its setup is sufficient for the classification task.
During the adversarial training this setup can be updated if the structure is not optimised for the additional task of a model independent of systematics.

This chapter describes the hyperparameter optimisation of the first network. The first section deals with the input information.
The second section explains the choice of the architecture followed by the setup of the optimiser.
Lastly regularisation of the network is described.
