\section{Machine Learning}

The central aspect of this work is the us of machine learning in the field of High Energy Collider Physics, its difficulties and the steps of its fine tuning.\\
This chapter introduces Machine Learning as a tool for analysis. Neural Networks are explained in detail to allow understanding the dificulties that arise from systematic uncertainties when using simulations for teaching the Networks to distinguish.
The concept of Adversarial Networks as introduced by Goodfellow is introduced and explained for the case of minimizing the effect of systematic uncertainties.

\subsection{The concept of machine learning}

Machine learning is the concept of developing a system that can learn from experience. Not only be remebering but mostly by identifying patterns and using them to gain information.
