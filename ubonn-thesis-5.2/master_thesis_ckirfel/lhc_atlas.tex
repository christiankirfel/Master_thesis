\section{The LHC}

Due to the statistical nature of Particle Physics it does not only require sufficiently high energies but also an exceedingly large amount of data to allow significant results.
The LHC provides both with an energy of and an integrated luminosity of.
The analysis in this work used data(?) based on the ATLAS detector, on of the four detectors at the LHC.

This chapter introduces the LHC, followed by the most important aspects of the ATLAS detector. In the next chapter the trigr and so on shit fuck
