\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:ack1}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like to thank the members of my group who read and criticised
different versions of this guide. Questions and suggestions from
students who used previous versions of the guide have led to a number
of improvements. The authors of the book \enquote{Physics at the
Terascale} provided many examples of different \LaTeX{} usage and
conventions that were also very helpful. Andrii Verbytskyi provided
the tikz examples.
Miriam Ramos provided advice and input on how to implement references 
in the style usually used in astronomy publications and theses.
Kaven Yau suggested the new (as of version 4.0) way of steering which cover
and title pages are included.

Acknowledgements at the beginning should be a \Macro{chapter*} so that they
do not appear in the Table of Contents.
