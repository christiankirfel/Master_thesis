\noindent
In this section I document briefly the major changes to this guide. I
also indicate other topics for which I would like to add some more
information.

\begin{longtable}{llp{0.7\textwidth}}
  \caption{Changes to the \Package{ubonn-thesis} and \Package{ubonn-biblatex} style files.}
  \endhead
  \toprule
  Date & Version & Comment\\
  \midrule
  30 Jun 2016 & 5.1 & Add \Package{hepnicenames} and \Package{heppennames} packages.
    Add a bit more documentation on particle definitions.
    Added some more information and updated the guidelines on positioning of figures.
    Month and address/location are not include in references by default.\\
    
  15 Mar 2016 & 5.0 & Move from SVN to Git repository. Update documentation accordingly.
    Small fix so comma is not part of link from journal entry to DOI.
    Add a workaround for conflicts involving \Package{refcheck}, \Package{subcaption} and \Package{refcheck}.\\
    
  27 Aug 2015 & 4.0 & Add options for thesis type and stage.
    This simplifies and improves how the different cover and title pages are included.
    Put bibliography before appendix (this seems to be more standard).
    With this the bibliography moves into \Macro{mainmatter}.
    Use \KOMAScript{} options to add lines around chapter headings -- small change to the style.
    Add a skeleton that compiles with \TeXLive 2009 -- \texttt{make new09} command.
    Remove most advice and switches to use \texttt{bibtex8}.
    The 2009 version of the skeleton now uses traditional \BibTeX.
    Add ATLAS bibliography style files.
    Small updates to submission instructions and operating systems.\\
  
  02 Feb 2015 & 3.0 & Add ability to pass options to \texttt{ubonn-thesis.sty}
  using the \Package{keyval} package.
  \TeXLive 2014 is now the default.
  The \TeXLive version can be passed as an option. Improve its handling.
  Change a few default packages:
  \Package{longtable} $\to$ \Package{xtab};
  \Package{subfig} $\to$ \Package{subcaption} (for \TeXLive 2012 and later).
  Add options for different fonts. Stick with \Package{txfonts} as default, 
  but encourage use of \Package{newtx} if it is available.
  Add inclusion of \Package{biblatex} package into style file.
  Put \Package{biblatex} fine tuning into a new style file \texttt{ubonn-biblatex.sty}.
  Add options so that bibliography in standard astronomy style can be produced.
  Add \Macro{boldmath} command to bold font by default.
  Remove inclusion of \Package{feynmf}/\Package{feynmp} by default.\\
  
  10 Jul 2013 & 2.1 & Move thesis main file to \texttt{mythesis}
  subdirectory. Also put \texttt{Makefile} and copy
  \texttt{ubonn-thesis.sty} into \texttt{mythesis} subdirectory. Split
  main \texttt{Makefile} into several files, one for thesis, one for
  the guide an done for
  pictures and Feynman graphs.\\
  
  06 Jul 2013 &     & Use the \Package{standalone} package in the
  \TikZ\ figures. Add commented out code to \Package{feynmp}
  figures to show how to use \Package{standalone} for them as
  well. Move the guide main file to the
  \texttt{guide} subdirectory so that this works properly.\\
  
  04 Jul 2013 &     & Add a few examples of using the \Package{tikz}
  package. Switch to using \Package{feynmp} rather than
  \Package{feynmf} by default (as of \TeXLive 2011). Add \Macro{write18}
  statements for
  Feynman graphs with \Package{feynmp} and adapt \texttt{Makefile}.\\
  
  18 May 2013 &     & Add some information on the \Package{refcheck} package
  and back-referencing with \Package{biblatex}.\\
  
  23 Apr 2013 & 2.0 & Rename pibonn-thesis to ubonn-thesis. Make thesis
  submission a separate chapter (so that PhD submission can also be a
  separate document). Make \TeXLive
  2011 the default. Make Inspire rather than Spires default.\\
  \bottomrule
  \label{tab:ubonn-thesis:changes}
\end{longtable}

Table~\ref{tab:pibonn-thesis:changes} summarises the changes that were made during the 
development of the \Package{pibonn-thesis} package.

\begin{longtable}{lp{0.8\textwidth}}
  \caption{Changes to the \Package{pibonn-thesis} style files.}
  \endhead
  \toprule
  Date & Comment\\
  \midrule
  31 Mar 2013 & Add instructions on how to use \LaTeX\ backport under
  Ubuntu variants.\\
  
  28 Mar 2013 & Updated and hopefully complete and correct
  instructions on thesis submission. Move to USenglish and UKenglish
  as languages rather than american and british.\\
  
  14 Mar 2013 & Change the style of the chapter heading. Add some more
  instructions which cover pages are needed when.\\
  
  24 Jan 2013 & Add watermark possibility with \Package{background} package.\\
  
  14 Dec 2012 & Added a glossary and a list of acronyms as well as
  instructions on how to make them. Skeleton CV for PhD thesis added
  -- has still to be cross-checked with the Promotionsbüro.\\
  
  04 Dec 2012 & Add some hints on what title pages to use when and
  what you have to worry about when printing and submitting your thesis.\\
  
  02 Dec 2012 & Use American-style quotation marks by default with the
  \Package{csquotes} package. This means outer \enquote{double quote
    and inner \enquote{single quote}}, which seems to be quite
  common, even in British (UK) English publications such as CERN Courier.\\
  
  22 Oct 2012 & Replace \Package{color} by \Package{xcolor} so that
  one can colour boxes around links.\\
  
  12 Oct 2012 & Add some more information on installing \TeXLive
  2011. Add some thesis examples. Add some hints on using
  Kile. Sorting of references turned off for \TeXLive 2011. Some
  more information on which reference types to use added.\\
  
  24 Aug 2012 & Update SVN information due to PI changes.\\
  
  19 Jun 2012 & Make a separate file for cover so that page
  numbering starts properly.\\
  
  18 Jun 2012 & Add instructions for \TeXLive under Windows.\\
  
  05 Jun 2012 & Move current version into the trunk subdirectory to
  conform to usual SVN structure.\\
  
  24 May 2012 & Made the guide more generic so that it can be sent to
  other institutes. Used \Macro{ifthenelse} everywhere rather than
  having separate files for different \TeXLive versions.\\
  
  15 May 2012 & Reorganised switching between \TeXLive 2009 and
  2011. The version should be set first before loading the style
  file. Without the option \TeXLive 2009 is assumed. Some changes to
  adapt to stricter \Package{siunitx} version 2 requirements and new
  options. Added some comments on ways of writing axis names for
  coordinates. Added some information on using \Package{feynmp}
  rather than \Package{feynmf}.\\
  
  14 May 2012 & Only include one title page for Bachelor theses.  Add
  some more sources of information. Reorganise and improve a bit the
  references chapter. Reorganise information on installing a \TeX\
  setup. Move Windows XP to a separate subsection. Add a bit of
  information for MacOSX. Add a bit of information on
  the \Package{subfiles} package.\\
  
  06 Mar 2012 & Add more information on formatting footnotes.\\
  
  23 Jan 2012 & Added more and better examples of using the
  \Option{S} column format in tables.\\
  
  20 Jan 2012 & Add more information on \Package{biblatex} and make
  this the default (unsorted, numeric) for a thesis.\\
  
  11 Jul 2011 & Removed dot after chapter and figure/table numbers.\\
  
  17 Jun 2011 & Added discussion of \Package{siunitx} package. Added
  some extra tables that also use this package. Added
  \Package{booktabs} package which include \Macro{toprule},
  \Macro{midrule} and \Macro{bottomrule} to get better looking
  tables. Also switched from \Macro{usepackage} to
  \Macro{RequirePackage} in \texttt{ubonn-thesis.sty}.\\
  
  23 May 2011 & Changed default font to txfonts. Added more font
  options and explanation.\\
  \bottomrule
  \label{tab:pibonn-thesis:changes}
\end{longtable}

Here is a list of ideas for more information that could be added to
this guide:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add drawing of Feynman graphs with \Package{axodraw} and/or
  \Package{jaxodraw}.
\item Add instructions on content of CV and summary for PhD thesis.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{\TeX{} setup and packages}
\label{sec:app:tex}
%==============================================================================

\LaTeX{} file: \url{./guide_appendix.tex}\\[1ex]
\noindent
If you have an older \LaTeX{} installation (with a \KOMAScript{}
version less than 3.0) you will probably have to make a few changes to
the style file and your main thesis file.
In particular the \Macro{KOMAoptions} macro does not exist. In this case, you
have to put the options into the document class options. Also some of
the names have changed. Consult the \KOMAScript{} manual for more
information.

Other packages that I recommend and that are subject to rapid
development still are \Package{biblatex} and
\Package{siunitx}. If you want to fully exploit their capabilities,
you should make sure you \LaTeX{} installation is as recent as
possible -- I recommend \TeXLive 2013, 2014 or 2015.

As I mentioned in the introduction, the institute is a member of Dante
and I therefore receive a copy of the \TeX\ Collection DVD every
year. You can also download the installation you need from the \TeX\
Users (TUG) group web page: \url{http://www.tug.org/texcollection}.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Integrated environments}
\label{sec:app:compile}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:tips:do}, I highly recommend
that you use an integrated environment for editing and compiling your
thesis. All such tools allow you to define projects, which then know
about which files should be included when compiling.

\TeXstudio\index{TeXstudio} and
\TeXmaker\index{TeXmaker} can be installed under Windows, MacOSX or
Linux. I have tried \TeXstudio in all three systems and it works nicely. It
can be downloaded from \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/}. Others
report good experience with \TeXmaker (under Ubuntu).
It is available as an Ubuntu package or from
\url{http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker}.
\TeXmaker and \TeXstudio (\TeX makerX) split in 2009, so both packages
contain a lot of similarities.
Kile\index{kile} is quite popular, especially if you use the KDE
desktop environment. 

You can also make a glossary from within \TeXstudio. In order to do
this you have to define a user build command. You can find such commands
under:  \textsf{Options} $\to$ \textsf{Configure TeXstudio} $\to$
\textsf{Build}. I defined a new command which I called
\enquote{BuildWithGlossary}. This executes \texttt{pdflatex, biber,
  makeindex, makeglossary, pdflatex, pdflatex}.

I used to use \texttt{emacs}\index{emacs} and AUCTeX, as I can
then use the same editor for everything. Note that the
RefTeX\index{RefTeX} mode in \texttt{emacs} also provides powerful
tools for finding and inserting cross-references and the names of
citations easily.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\TeXstudio}
\label{sec:app:texstudio}\index{TeXStudio}

I have been using \TeXstudio as my main tool for creating \LaTeX\ documents since 2013.
One very nice feature is that it works under MacOSX, Windows and Linux.
It is fairly easy to adapt to your preferences.
Additional keyboard shortcuts can be added and the editor can be customised.
I usually change the \texttt{TAB} behaviour so that spaces rather than TABs are inserted.

If you use the integrated PDF viewer, it is very easy to switch between the PDF file and
the \LaTeX\ source code, which is extremely helpful.
You can also usually click on an error in the Message window and the cursor will jump to the right spot.
This makes debugging and proofreading much easier.

It is easy to switch between \texttt{biber} and \texttt{bibtex} using the Build preferences.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Kile}
\label{sec:app:kubuntu:kile}\index{kile}

Many people use Kile as their environment for editing and compiling
\LaTeX. If you use \texttt{bibtex} for your references then the default
setup does not have to be changed. If you want to use the
\Option{biber}\index{biber} backend then you should integrate the
command into Kile.

To do this you need to do the following:
In Kile: \Option{Settings $\to$ Configure Kile $\to$ Tools $\to$ Build} and
then insert a new tool (Biber) on the left-hand side. It is probably
best to define the class of the tool as \BibTeX. Then on the
right-hand side in the \Option{General} tab the command should be
\texttt{biber} and the option \texttt{\%S}. In the \Option{Advanced}
tab you should set the \Option{Source extension} to \texttt{aux} and
the \Option{Target extension} to \texttt{bbl}.

I would then recommend adding a new configuration to the
\Option{QuickBuild} called \Option{PDFLaTeX+Biber+ViewPDF} that
executes the commands: \texttt{PDFLaTeX, Biber, PDFLaTeX, PDFLaTeX,
  ViewPDF}. This is also the series of commands that the
\texttt{Makefile} executes.

I have not yet investigated how to also make the glossary from within
Kile, but it should be possible to do it in the same way as you add a
\texttt{biber} command.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{MacOSX}
\label{sec:app:mac}\index{MacOSX}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the past year, I have been installing and running \LaTeX\ on a MacBook Pro.
The standard package you start with is \TeX Shop. 
Together with Basic\TeX\ this provides a basic environment. 
However, if you want to do more (like write a thesis),
you should install \TeXLive.
There is a complete \TeXLive installation call Mac\TeX\ 
that you can download from \url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}.
The Dante \TeX\ Collection DVD also includes Mac\TeX, which is what the \TeX Shop web page
recommends as the best combination to install.

As discussed above, there are MacOSX versions of \TeXstudio and \TeXmaker which you can try.
I have been using \TeXstudio.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{(Ku|Xu|U)buntu}
\label{sec:app:kubuntu}\index{Linux}\index{Ubuntu}\index{Kubuntu}\index{Xubuntu}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For most of my tests with Ubuntu I have been using Xubuntu 14.04 and 
\TeXLive 2013. Very recently I have also used Xubuntu 16.04 and \TeXLive 015.

I also made the guide on a plain Xubuntu 12.04
installation, which used the default packages from the Xubuntu image. At
installation time I enabled the usage of 3rd party non-free
software. This is be needed for \texttt{acroread} among other
things.\footnote{Nowadays you have to download \texttt{acroread} from
  the Adobe web page.} 
If you want to write your thesis in British (UK) English you should make sure
that that language is fully installed. If you want to write your
thesis in German, then also install German as a language, even if
your system is in English.

I explicitly installed the following packages in addition:
\begin{verbatim}
(k|x)ubuntu-restricted-extras
git #Used to be subversion
texlive
texlive-doc-en
texlive-science
texlive-science-doc
texlive-lang-german
texlive-fonts-recommended
texlive-fonts-extra
texlive-latex-extra
feynmf
texlive-bibtex-extra
biber
\end{verbatim}
For Ubuntu 13.04 and later I also had to install \texttt{texlive-metapost} in
order to compile the guide.

\noindent
(Ku|Xu|U)buntu 12.04 has \TeXLive 2009 installed by default.
You will need to install \texttt{texlive-latex3}.
Later versions include the relevant packages in \texttt{texlive-latex-recommended} which is installed by default.
You also have to install \texttt{biblatex} rather than \texttt{texlive-bibtex-extra}.
I recommend using traditional \BibTeX rather than \Package{biber} with such an old version,so do not install \texttt{biber}.

\noindent
Using these packages I was able to issue to following commands to
produce the guide (assuming that you have \TeXLive 2011 or later):
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://git.physik.uni-bonn.de/cgit/projects/ubonn-thesis.git
cd ubonn-thesis
\end{verbatim}
Set the \Macro{texlive} variable appropriately in \texttt{guide/thesis\_guide.tex}.
Then the following worked:
\begin{verbatim}
cd guide
make guide
\end{verbatim}
so all packages are there as well as at least the default font which I
selected.
If your version of \TeXLive is older than 2013, you should set
\Macro{texlive} accordingly and not pass the option \texttt{newtx} to \Package{ubonn-thesis}.
In addition, I had to download and install the package \Package{physics} from CTAN when
using \TeXLive 2011 and Scientific Linux 6.

The default version of the guide uses \Option{biber} for the
\Package{biblatex} package and includes\\
\texttt{./guide/refs/example\_refs-utf8.bib} which contains some umlauts.\footnote{%
The same references using normal ascii test (suitable for \texttt{bibtex}) can be found in
\texttt{./guide/refs/example\_refs-ascii.bib}.}
You give the command \texttt{make guide} to compile, which uses \texttt{biber}\index{biber} rather than
\texttt{bibtex}\index{bibtex} to process the \texttt{.bib} files.

For a older version of \TeXLive (2009), in addition to changing
\Macro{texlive} in \texttt{thesis\_guide.tex} to \texttt{2009}.
you have to compile using the command \texttt{make guide09}.
i.e.\ do the following:
\begin{verbatim}
make feynmf
make guide09
\end{verbatim}

The default version of the guide also compiles on ATLAS Bonn desktop
computers ((K)Ubuntu 12.04 with \TeXLive 2012). If you want to use
\Package{feynmf} instead of \Package{feynmp} to compile the guide, you
have to pass the option \Option{feynmf} instead of \Option{feynmp} to \texttt{ubonn-thesis.sty} 
and give the command \texttt{make feynmf} before \texttt{make guide}.

If you want to switch from \texttt{biber}\index{biber} to
\texttt{bibtex}\index{bibtex} or \texttt{bibtex8}\index{bibtex8} or vice versa, give the commands
\texttt{make cleanguide cleanbbl cleanblx} before you try to compile
the guide (or your thesis).

In order to edit \LaTeX\ you need an editor such as \texttt{emacs} or
use a program such as \texttt{kile} (and the associated
\texttt{kile-doc}), \TeXstudio or \TeXmaker. These were discussed
briefly in the previous section.

If your \LaTeX\ installation is old, you may want to bring it
up-to-date.  For Ubuntu variants there is a simple solution. Just add
\TeXLive backports to your list of sources (use the \texttt{sudo
  apt-add-repository ppa:texlive-backports/ppa} command). You should
then be able to give the command \texttt{sudo apt-get update; sudo
  apt-get upgrade}. Note that this variant will overwrite your current
\LaTeX\ installation. An alternative is the method discussed in the
following paragraphs, which allows you to have two different installations in
parallel.

A \TeX nische Komödie issue (3/2011) contained detailed instructions on
how to install a newer version of \TeXLive in parallel to the
default version in Kubuntu (Ubuntu works in almost exactly the
same way). 
For a while, I did this as standard practice on my laptop and it worked very well.
Another useful source of information on how to install \TeXLive can be found under
\url{http://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html}.

A brief summary of how to do the installation by hand: you must have
\texttt{perl-tk} installed.
Go to a directory where you want the
install script to be and then execute the following chain of commands:
\begin{verbatim}
wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz
tar zxvf install-tl-unx.tar.gz
cd install-tl-...
sudo ./install-tl -gui perltk
  Turn off some of the languages
  Make sure installation is in /usr/local/texlive
  Install
\end{verbatim}
I installed the scheme \Option{scheme-tetex} and added the
collections: \Option{BibTeX additional styles}, \Option{Generic additional
  packages}, \Option{LaTeX additional packages} and
\Option{Natural and computer sciences}.  When the
installation is complete (can easily take \numrange{1}{2} hours):
\begin{verbatim}
cd ..
echo 'export PATH=/opt/texbin:${PATH}' > texlive.sh
sudo cp texlive.sh /etc/profile.d/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2011/bin/i386-linux /opt/texbin
\end{verbatim}
If you have a 64-bit installation replace \texttt{i386-linux} with
\texttt{x86\_64-linux}. Note that the last 3 commands set things up so
that \texttt{/opt/texbin} is at the beginning of your \texttt{PATH}
and that \LaTeX\ is then taken from there rather than the usual
\texttt{/usr/bin}.

With Kubuntu 13.04, I had to install \texttt{texdoc} in addition in
order to be able to use it to access the documentation with
it.\footnote{This was not necessary for earlier (K)Ubuntu versions. I
  found it a bit strange, but it seems to be needed.}

For updating, additions of packages etc., it is useful to define an
alias in your \texttt{.bashrc} or \texttt{.bash\_aliases}:
\begin{verbatim}
function sutlmgr () {
    if [[ -z "$@" ]]; then
      sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr -gui
    else
      sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr "$@"
    fi
}
\end{verbatim}
You then give the command \texttt{sutlmgr} to start the \TeXLive
manager interface. You can use this interface to install new packages
as well as to update the ones you have installed. If you want to
update things, you should first click on \enquote{Load default} to
load a repository and then you can do things such as \enquote{Update
  all installed}.

If you are using Ubuntu 11.10, you may well get an error:
\enquote{\texttt{sh: gnome-open: not found}} when you try to give a
\texttt{texdoc} command. I fixed this by making a
link from \texttt{/usr/local/bin/gnome-open} to
\texttt{/usr/bin/xdg-open}.



%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Windows}
\label{sec:app:windows}\index{windows}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also tried to to make the guide and a skeleton thesis under Windows. 
My tests have been done with Windows 7 and more recently Windows 10.
I simply downloaded the MiK\TeX\ installer from \url{http://miktex.org}.
This is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:app:miktex}.
You can also install \TeXLive for Windows. Some hints on how to do
this are given below (Section~\ref{sec:app:texlive}).\footnote{%
I have had success with the 2010 \TeX{} Collection DVD from Dante to install
pro\TeX t, which is based on MiK\TeX.
Newer versions should also work without problems.
What the user sees is \TeXworks
which is deliberately supposed to look like the Mac's \TeX Shop.}

Once you have a \TeX\ installation, you have to get the thesis style files and the guide.
To do this I used \texttt{TortoiseGit} which is available from
\url{https://tortoisegit.org} as the interface between Windows and
\texttt{Git}.\index{tortoisegit}\index{Git}

To checkout the files, simply start Windows Explorer and go to the
top-level directory where you want to do the checkout, right-click on
the mouse and enter\\
\texttt{https://git.physik.uni-bonn.de/cgit/projects/ubonn-thesis.git}
as the URL.
If you do this you can stay at the cutting edge!
If you want a particular version then specify the branch you want, e.g.\ \enquote{v5.0}.
You can of course simply download the appropriate tar file from the PI webpages.

To set up your thesis, you have to do by hand what the
\texttt{Makefile} does under Linux or install GNU Make.
If you want to do it by hand, you should make a new directory
\texttt{mythesis}, copy \texttt{thesis\_skel/thesis\_skel.tex} to
\texttt{mythesis/mythesis.tex}, and copy the rest of the files you need from
\texttt{thesis\_skel} into \texttt{mythesis}. In addition you should
copy the style files \texttt{ubonn-thesis.sty} and \texttt{ubonn-biblatex.sty} into the
\texttt{mythesis} directory.

To compile things, I ran the sequence PDF\LaTeX, \BibTeX, PDF\LaTeX,
PDF\LaTeX\ to get the output file for the skeleton thesis.
If you want to use \texttt{biber} instead of traditional \BibTeX, then you should
change the \BibTeX\ command from \texttt{bibtex} to \texttt{biber} in
\TeXstudio or \TeXworks.

If you want to install GNU Make you can try the following:
You should install the \enquote{Minimal Gnu for Windows} from \url{http://www.mingw.org}.
I downloaded and ran \texttt{mingw-get-setup.exe}.
Once you have installed it you can run the \enquote{MinGW Installer} to install the software you want.
I think you should install \Package{msys-base} from \enquote{Basic Setup}.
This installs \texttt{make} and quite a lot of other typical Unix commands.
Finally you have to add \verb|C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin| to your \texttt{PATH}.
One way to do this is with the command \verb|setx PATH %PATH%;C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin| using a Windows Command Prompt, 
i.e.\ \texttt{cmd.exe}.
You can also use the GUI in the System Administration to set environment variables.
If you get \texttt{make} to work properly you start \texttt{cmd.exe},
navigate to the correct directory and give the usual commands to create and compile your thesis:
\begin{verbatim}
make new
make
\end{verbatim}

\TeXstudio knows about indexes and glossaries. You have to set up a
user command to execute \texttt{makeindex} and \texttt{makeglossaries}
as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:app:compile}. With the addition of
these commands, you should also be able to compile this guide.

If you run PDF\LaTeX\ with the option \texttt{-enable-write18} and
include appropriate \texttt{mpost} commands in your \LaTeX\ file(s), as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fig:feynman:feynmf}, Feynman graphs made
using \Package{feynmp} work well. With \TeXstudio, you can simply
include this option in the PDF\LaTeX\ command: \textsf{Options} $\to$
\textsf{Configure TeXstudio} $\to$ \textsf{Commands}.

I have not invested any effort in trying to get \texttt{feynmf}
working under Windows. The output files are produced, but I have not
tried to run Metafont on them.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{MiK\TeX}
\label{sec:app:miktex}

I have installed \TeX\ under Windows both from the \TeX{} Collection
2010 DVD and via a download from Internet. For the DVD I logged in as
an Administrator and then opened the DVD. It opened a \TeX\ Collection
window and I then clicked on pro\TeX t Quick Install and installed
MiK\TeX{} (minimal version),\index{MiKTeX}
Ghostscript\index{ghostscript} and Ghostview\index{ghostview} for all users.
Once the installation was finished, I also updated all the
packages using the MiK\TeX{} Maintenance (Admin) $\to$ Update (Admin)
program. Be patient -- these updates always take a while!

With the minimal version of MiK\TeX{} you are then asked whether to
install the missing packages when first compiling a file that needs
them. Note that such missing packages are installed in your local
directory tree and not in the central directory tree.
This means that if you want to update MiK\TeX{} in the future
you should run the MiK\TeX{} Update both as Admin and as a normal user.
Be patient if the first compilation of a document appears to hang.
This usually means that new packages are being installed.

Note that the Dante \TeX\ Collection 2011 DVD has dropped
\TeXnicCenter within pro\TeX t and is using the \TeX makerX front-end
instead. \TeX makerX has recently been superseded by \TeXstudio, My
comments on \TeXnicCenter have been relegated to
Chapter~\ref{sec:app:old}. There is also the package \TeXmaker.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\TeXLive}
\label{sec:app:texlive}

You can install \TeXLive instead of pro\TeX t. To do that you can
either use the \TeX\ Collection DVD or download \TeXLive. If you
download \TeXLive you should unzip the file that you get and go to the
directory \texttt{install-tl/install-tl-YYYYMMDD}. In that directory you
should run \texttt{install-tl-advanced.bat} as Administrator if you want to install
\TeXLive in a system directory. I installed the \enquote{medium}
scheme. The following extra collections were needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsf{BibTeX additional styles}
\item \textsf{Generic additional packages}
\item \textsf{LaTeX additional packages} -- needed for \Package{csquotes}
\item \textsf{Natural and computer sciences}
\end{itemize}
I also added the German documentation. Do not forget to toggle the
option \Option{All users} if you want more than one user to be able to
use \LaTeX\ on your machine. If you forget one of the above
collections, you can install the missing packages later.

While MiK\TeX\ can install missing packages on the fly, this does not
seem to be the case for \TeXLive. To install extra packages you should
start the \TeXLive manager and before doing anything else you should
load the default repository.

You can either use \TeXworks as the front end or you can install
\TeXstudio or \TeXmaker.

For a PhD thesis, as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:submit:phd}, you
have to print and bind the five copies that are needed by the
university library externally. Some print shops in the Bonn region
that can supply the required quality at a reasonable price are:

\chapter{Making a glossary or list of acronyms}
\label{sec:app:glossary}
%==============================================================================

\LaTeX{} file: \url{./guide_appendix.tex}\\[1ex]
\noindent
What is the difference between a glossary and a list of acronyms? They
are in fact very similar. A list of acronyms is probably most
appropriate for defining the abbreviations used for detector names,
e.g.\ the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC). A glossary is used for
defining terms, e.g.\ \enquote{\textbf{transition radiation}: transition
radiation can be emitted when a particle crosses the boundary between
two media with different dielectric constants}. A list of acronyms is
probably a good idea to include in any thesis; a glossary may be
helpful as well.

Several packages are available to help in the creation of a glossary:
\begin{description}
\item[\Package{glossaries}] A new glossary package that can do
  everything! This is what I use here.
\item[\Package{nomencl}] Another glossary package that I used in the book
  \enquote{Physics at the Terascale}.
\item[\Package{glossary}] Replaced by \Package{glossaries} in
  \TeXLive 2012 and also available with \TeXLive 2009.
\item[\Package{glosstex}] Rather an old package that looks to be quite
  simple to use.
\end{description}

A short introduction to these packages can be found in the \TeX nische
Komödie 4/2012.

The \Package{nomencl} package is maybe the easiest to use for creating
a simple list of acronyms. If you want to change the formatting or do
anything other than create a simple list, it is probably worth
investigating \Package{glossaries}.

The nice thing about \Package{glossaries} is that it works with
\Package{hyperref} so that you can even click on an acronym and find
its definition. In this guide I included the package with the option
\Option{acronym}, in order to get both a glossary and a list of
acronyms. I also included the option \Option{toc}, so that the
glossary and list of acronyms are included in the table of
contents. You tell it to to make a glossary (and list of acronyms) by
giving the command \Macro{makeglossaries} in the preamble and you
print the glossary (usually at the end of the document) with the
\Macro{printglossaries} command. I have not included these commands in
the thesis skeleton, as the \Package{glossaries} package is rather new
and may not be available in older \TeX\ installations. In order to
process the glossary, you need to run the command
\texttt{makeglossaries filename}. This is included in the
\texttt{Makefile} for the commands \texttt{make guide} and
\texttt{make guide09} and should be added to \texttt{make thesis}
and/or \texttt{make thesis09} if you want to make a glossary for your
thesis.

If you use the package \Package{xtab} for long tables,
then you should include \Package{glossaries} with the option \Option{nosuper}
to avoid it loading \Package{supertabular}.
Use styles with a \texttt{long} rather than a \texttt{super} variant if you want such features.

I illustrate the use with the standard description of the ZEUS
detector, which includes the abbreviations that are used in the rest
of a ZEUS paper.  As a first step you define the terms for the
glossary and the acronyms.  In this guide, the acronyms and the
glossary entries are defined in the file
\url{guide_glossary.tex}. These definitions must come before
they are used. You can decide whether it is best to have them in a
single file, or define them just before they are used. When they are
printed at the end, they will be sorted alphabetically.

Once an acronym is defined, the first time the acronym is used,
\Macro{gls}\{acronym\}, the full text and the abbreviation is
printed. Every time after that only the abbreviation is printed.

\section{ZEUS detector description}
\label{sec:app:glossary:zeus}

In the kinematic range of the analysis, charged particles were tracked
in the \gls{CTD} and the
\gls{MVD}. These components operated in a magnetic
field of \SI{1.43}{\tesla} provided by a thin superconducting solenoid. The
\gls{CTD} consisted of 72~cylindrical drift-chamber layers, organised in nine
superlayers covering the polar-angle region
$\ang{15} < \theta < \ang{164}$.
%
The \gls{MVD} consisted of a barrel (BMVD) and a forward (FMVD)
section. The BMVD contained three layers and provided polar-angle
coverage for tracks from \ang{30} to \ang{150}. The four-layer FMVD
extended the polar-angle coverage in the forward region to
\ang{7}. After alignment, the single-hit resolution of the MVD was
\SI{24}{\micro\metre}. The \gls{DCA} of tracks to the nominal vertex in
$X$--$Y$ was measured to have a resolution, averaged over the
azimuthal angle, of $(46 \oplus 122 /
  p_{T})\,\si{\micro\metre}$, with $p_{T}$ in \si{\GeV}.  For \gls{CTD}-\gls{MVD} tracks
that pass through all nine \gls{CTD} superlayers, the momentum
resolution was $\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} = 0.0029 p_{T} \oplus 0.0081
\oplus 0.0012/p_{T}$, with $p_{T}$ in \si{\GeV}.

The high-resolution \gls{CAL} consisted of three parts: the forward
(FCAL), the barrel (BCAL) and the rear (RCAL) calorimeters. Each part
was subdivided transversely into towers and longitudinally into one
electromagnetic section (EMC) and either one (in RCAL) or two (in BCAL
and FCAL) hadronic sections (HAC). The smallest subdivision of the
calorimeter was called a cell.  The \gls{CAL} energy resolutions, as
measured under test-beam conditions, were $\sigma(E)/E=0.18/\sqrt{E}$
for electrons and $\sigma(E)/E=0.35/\sqrt{E}$ for hadrons, with $E$ in
\si{\GeV}.  \clearpage

We start a new page so that you can see how the cross-referencing
works.  ZEUS had quite a large assortment of tracking detectors. In the
forward direction there was the \gls{FTD} and the \gls{TRD}. The
\gls{TRD} was replaced by the \gls{STT} for the HERA~2 running
period.  In the middle of the detector, the \gls{CTD} was always
there, while the \gls{MVD} was also installed later.

\chapter{Plots with \Package{\TikZ}}
\label{sec:app:tikz}
%==============================================================================

Figure~\ref{fig:tikz:syst} shows how you can produce a plot showing
the contributions of many different systematic uncertainties to a
result. Note that this plot uses some modern features of
the \Package{tikz} and \Package{pgfplots} packages. Hence it is only included if
this guide is compiled with \TeXLive 2011 or later.

\chapter{Long tables}
\label{sec:app:tables}
%==============================================================================

\LaTeX{} file: \url{./guide_appendix.tex}\\[1ex]
\noindent
Long and complicated tables, such as tables containing the breakdown
of the systematic error for each data point are usually put into the
appendices. Code or data cards can also be included here.  Examples of
complicated typesetting have been given already in
Chapter~\ref{sec:table}. In this appendix I give an example of a table
(Table~\ref{tab:alphabet}) that goes over more than one page using the
\Package{xtab} package. If instead you use \Package{longtable},
note that it is a
combination of \Env{tabular} and \Env{table} in one
environment. 
As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{sec:package}, an alternative
is the \Package{supertabular} package.
 
While footnotes do not work properly in a
normal \Env{tabular}, but they do work in \Env{longtable}
if you use \Package{longtable}.
You can use the \Env{mpxtabuar} environment to include footnotes in a table
if you use \Package{xtab}.

If you use the \Package{xtab} package, 
note that you should specify the table header and footer outside the table itself.
Do not include \Env{xtabular} inside a \Env{table} environment, as the table will
then be output on one page, which is not what you want!
Such packages sometimes need a bit of help to get the page breaks in the right place.
According to the \Package{xtab} documentation you should first try to play
around with the variable \Macro{xentrystretch}. The default value is \num{0.1}.
Decrease this to put more on a page and increase it to get less.
You can even set it to a negative value!
The value can be set per table.
As an alternative you can use the \Macro{shrinkheight} command.

\chapter{A famous equation is $E = mc^{2}$}
\label{sec:emc2}\index{math!bold}
%==============================================================================

\LaTeX{} file: \url{./guide_appendix.tex}\\[1ex]
\noindent
This chapter was included to check that one gets bold mathematics in
a chapter/section title, but not in the table of contents.

As of release of the \Package{ubonn-thesis} package, no special handling of
titles should be necessary. This is because the following line was added:
\begin{verbatim}
  \def\bfseries{\fontseries\bfdefault\selectfont\boldmath}
\end{verbatim}
%No optional title for a chapter is needed as the chapter title is typeset in bold
%font also in the table of contents.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{A slightly less famous equation $F = m a$}
\label{sec:fma}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The title here does not include \Macro{boldmath}, as the bold font series turns on bold math by default.
Note that the
section in the table of contents is typeset in a normal font when
writing a book or report.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section[The cross-section is given by $\sigma = N / \mathcal{L}$]%
        {The cross-section is given by $\sigma = N / \mathcal{L}$}
\label{sec:sig}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This attempt includes \Macro{boldmath} by hand and uses Greek letters and some specific font.
It appears to also work OK.


%==============================================================================
\chapter{Old or obsolete information and instructions}
\label{sec:app:old}
%==============================================================================

With time things change! Some of the instruction or packages that I
recommended at an earlier time are superseded. Operating systems and
\TeX\ installations also change with time. In order to avoid
cluttering up the main chapters of the guide with outdated or obsolete
information, such things are collected in this appendix.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{More on \Package{feynmf}}
\label{sec:app:feynmf}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I relegate this section to the chapter on obsolete instructions,
because I think it is much easier to just use \Package{feynmp} than
\Package{feynmf}. If you have \TeXLive 2012, you can combine
\Package{feynmp} with \Package{standalone} for a very convenient way
to develop and include Feynman graphs, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:fig:feynman:feynmf}.

If you use \Package{feynmp} you can just give the command \texttt{make
feynmp} and it will produce PDF files of all the \texttt{tex} files in
the \texttt{feynmf} subdirectory.

If you do not want to include the \Package{feynmf} commands for Feynman
graphs in the thesis (or input the file containing them), you can try
to make encapsulated Postscript (or PDF) files that contain a single
Feynman graph and then include these as usual in your thesis.

If you want to use \Package{feynmf} you can start with the
\texttt{feynmf} command on the \texttt{tex} file containing the
graph.\footnote{Note that the example files that are included in this
  document tree are missing the \Macro{documentclass} and
  \Macro{usepackage} commands.}  This produces a \texttt{dvi} file
that you then have to convert to Encapsulated Postscript and/or
PDF. This is not totally trivial.

The best way is to specify the options to the \Package{geometry}
package so that the page size corresponds to the Feynman graph. For a
graph with size $(50,50)$, as specified at the beginning of the
\Env{fmfgraph*} environment (within \Macro{unitlength} in \si{\mm}), the
following wrapper works well:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
%
\usepackage[papersize={60mm,56mm},text={58mm,52mm},centering]{geometry}
\usepackage{feynmf}
\usepackage{color}
%
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\begin{center}
\fbox{\input{figs/feynmf/ep_nc.tex}}
\end{center}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

I also had success with the command chain:
\begin{verbatim}
feynmf ep_nc
dvips ep_nc
ps2epsi ep_nc.ps
\end{verbatim}
and then you can include \texttt{ep\_nc.epsi} in your \LaTeX
file.\footnote{By default \LaTeX{} will not find \texttt{.epsi} files
  with the \Macro{includegraphics} command. Rename them to
  \texttt{.eps} instead or add \texttt{.epsi} to the list of file
  types that \Macro{includegraphics} can handle.} To
get PDF you need one more step:
\begin{verbatim}
epstopdf ep_nc.epsi
\end{verbatim}

An alternative with explicit Metafont calls is:
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex ep_nc
mf '\mode=localfont; input ep_nc;'
pdflatex ep_nc
pdflatex ep_nc
\end{verbatim}
The trouble with this is that the Feynman graph is not clipped, unless
you have specified the page size appropriately as discussed above.

\section{Windows}
\label{sec:app:old:windows}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Windows XP}

As I know longer have access to a Windows XP machine, and Windows XP is
slowly disappearing, my experience with Windows XP stopped 2011.

I started the \TeX{} Collection 2010 DVD. I started it as an
Administrator, it opened a \TeX\ Collection window and I then clicked
on proTeXt Quick Install and installed MiK\TeX{} (minimal
version),\index{MiKTeX}\index{TeXnic Center} \TeXnicCenter,
Ghostscript and Ghostview for all users. Once the installation was
finished, I also updated all the packages using the MiK\TeX{}
Maintenance (Admin) $\to$ Update (Admin) program. Be patient -- these
updates always take a while!

You should then be able to double-click on \texttt{mythesis.tex} and
try to compile it! My first attempt at this failed. I had set
MiK\TeX{} to install missing packages, but it was supposed to ask me
first. This seems to work well if you are logged in as the same user
(with Administration rights) as the one who installed MiK\TeX. The
package updating does not seem to work properly (it only asks you for
the first missing package I think) if you are a normal user. After
going through the exercise once as an Administrator to compile the
skeleton thesis, I could also compile both the thesis and the guide as
a normal user.

The second attempt was a complete MiK\TeX{} installation. I told it to
install missing packages without asking. This also failed at the first
attempt as it was missing the package \Package{logreq} and somehow did
not install it automatically. I had to use the MiK\TeX{} Maintenance
(Admin) $\to$ Package Manager (Admin) to install \Package{logreq}.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\TeXnicCenter}
\label{sec:app:texnic}\index{TeXnic Center}

I tried out the \TeXnicCenter, which is also available. You first
have to tell it where to find the \LaTeX\ executables. In my case
this is \texttt{C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash MiKTeX
  2.8\textbackslash mktex\textbackslash bin}. You also have to tell
the program where to find Acrobat (Reader) although it should find it
automatically.

In the \TeXnicCenter I opened one of the main files, i.e.\
\texttt{mythesis.tex} or \texttt{thesis\_guide.tex} and then in the
\texttt{Project} menu I declared this file to be the main file for a
new project. You should declare the file format to be Unix. You can
then compile the project and look at the output by hitting
\texttt{Ctrl + F5}. It is also possible to set some options such that
you do not have to close the file in Acrobat Reader before compiling.

There is a small problem and irritation with \TeXnicCenter and
Acrobat Reader X. Under \texttt{Build} $\to$ \texttt{Define Output
  Profiles} $\to$ \texttt{Viewer} you have to change \texttt{acroview} to
\texttt{acroviewR10} in the three places where it is given. If you
then try to compile Adobe Reader opens but you get an error
message. Just view the output again \texttt{F5} and the PDF file will
be shown. Via Google, I found some tricks that are supposed to fix
this problem, but they did not work for me. You can also just start
Adobe Reader first and then \TeXnicCenter.

In general, I thought I liked the \TeXnicCenter somewhat more than
\TeXworks, which is the direct MiK\TeX{} interface. It allows you to
set up projects and you then have the ability to navigate easily
through all your files via the Navigator. However, it has a serious
problem in that it does not handle UTF-8 files properly. Although
support for UTF-8 has been advertised for almost two years I do not
see much signs of progress.

As \TeXnicCenter has been dropped on the Dante \TeX\ Collection 2011
DVD I have relegated this information to a subsection.
