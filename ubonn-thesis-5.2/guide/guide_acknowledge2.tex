\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:ack2}

There is plenty of discussion as to where the acknowledgements should
go in a thesis. The two most common places are just after the title
and dedication or right at the end. For the purpose of this guide I
include both options.

Acknowledgements at the end should be in \Macro{chapter} so that they
appear in the Table of Contents.
