To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the

two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
